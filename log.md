# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 13, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Began building data frame with the aim of running some Bayesian regression. Made use of dplyr

**Thoughts:**  dplyr has been something just beyond the horizon for awhile. Now it has arrived. I feel like I won't be able to really start with any data science until these sorts of manipulations are natural. 



### Day 2: June 14, 2017 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Data frame is complete and the Bayesian model is working. Next up, make a prediction. After that that rest is writing so I'll have to move onto another coding project

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**: [Rmd of the model](bayesian_project.Rmd)


### Day 3: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Models is built. Prediction is created. Most of my coding time was spent building a data frame for the movie I was going to make predictions for. Now it's a matter of trying to interpret the results. Part of tomorrow's (precoding) efforts will be devoted to deciding on my next few projects. 

**Thoughts** One thing about R is that the silliest things can cause problems. I feel like its probably a harder language to debug than many others. I think that I'm pretty good at getting things to run, but I wish I had a better sense of the significance of the models I am playing with.
